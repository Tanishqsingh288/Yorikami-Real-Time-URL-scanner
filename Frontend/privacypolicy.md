Privacy Policy for Yorikami Chrome Extension
Effective Date: 25-06-2025

Introduction
Yorikami (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Yorikami, a Chrome extension for real-time scanning and highlighting of malicious or suspicious web links, collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

This policy applies to all users of the Yorikami Chrome extension (“the Extension”), as well as any associated web services provided by us (such as the user dashboard).

By using Yorikami, you agree to this Privacy Policy and consent to the practices described herein.

1. Who We Are
Yorikami is a free Chrome browser extension developed and maintained by Tanishq Singh. Yorikami’s single purpose is to help you browse safely by scanning all web pages for unsafe links in real time, highlighting them clearly, and providing a secure dashboard to manage your link scan history.

We value user privacy and believe that security tools should not compromise the very privacy they protect.

2. Information We Collect
Yorikami is designed to minimize data collection. We only collect the narrowest information necessary to provide the Extension’s single purpose.

The types of information we may collect include:

A. Non-Personal Information
Website Content: Yorikami scans the content of the web pages you visit (specifically URLs and anchor text) in real time to detect potentially malicious or suspicious links. This content is scanned locally in your browser. We do not store or share this page content on our servers unless you choose to use the Deep Analysis feature.

Technical Information: Yorikami may collect non-identifiable technical information such as error logs or extension performance data to improve stability and functionality.

B. Personal Information
If you sign up for Yorikami’s optional dashboard, we collect and store:

Email Address: Required for account creation, login, and multi-factor authentication.

Login Credentials: We securely store hashed and salted credentials for authentication purposes.

Scan History: If you use the Deep Analysis feature, URLs you choose to analyze may be stored securely in your personal dashboard to provide you with risk scores, history, and management features.

3. How We Use Your Information
We use your information only for the Extension’s single purpose:

To scan and highlight suspicious or malicious links in real time.

To provide and maintain your secure user dashboard.

To improve, debug, and maintain Yorikami’s performance and security.

To communicate with you about your account (e.g., password reset, multi-factor authentication, or critical security updates).

We do not use your information for advertising, profiling, or any unrelated purpose.

4. How We Share Your Information
Yorikami does not sell or rent your information to third parties. We do not share your personal information except in the following limited circumstances:

With Your Consent: We may share information if you explicitly direct us to do so (e.g., if you export your scan history).

For Legal Reasons: We may disclose your information if required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Yorikami, our users, or others.

Service Providers: Yorikami may use secure third-party infrastructure (such as cloud hosting) to store backend data like scan reports. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data.

5. Your Privacy Controls and Choices
We believe you should have full control over your data. Yorikami provides the following choices:

Manage or Delete Scan History: You can view, re-analyze, or delete previously analyzed URLs from your personal dashboard at any time.

Account Deletion: If you wish to delete your Yorikami account, you can contact us at [singhtanishq288@gmail.com]. We will permanently delete your account and all associated data.

Limited Permissions: Yorikami only requests the permissions necessary to fulfill its single purpose. We never request permissions for unrelated features.

6. How We Secure Your Information
Yorikami takes data security seriously. We implement industry-standard measures to protect your information, including:

End-to-End Encryption: Communication between the Extension and our backend servers is secured using HTTPS.

Secure Storage: Personal information and scan history are stored in a secure database with access controls.

Minimal Data Retention: We store only what is necessary to provide the dashboard functionality. You can delete your data at any time.

No Remote Code Execution: Yorikami does not load or execute code from untrusted remote sources. All scanning scripts are bundled with the Extension to ensure your safety.

7. Children’s Privacy
Yorikami is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us immediately.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or for legal, regulatory, or operational reasons. We will notify users of material changes by updating this page and revising the “Effective Date” above.

We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
